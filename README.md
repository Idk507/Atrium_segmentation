# Atrium Segmentation

## Description
This project focuses on **atrium segmentation** using advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques. Atrium segmentation plays a vital role in the analysis of medical imaging data, particularly in the field of cardiology, where accurate segmentation of the atrial region is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning, and research.

The repository provides a computational pipeline for atrium segmentation, leveraging **Jupyter Notebooks** for interactive data exploration and model development. The project is designed to streamline the process of medical image segmentation, making it accessible for researchers and practitioners in the medical field.
